# PasswordManager
A fully functional Password Manager made in python

## Overview
This is my first ever python project and kinda my best and my most favourite project I've ever done.

Basically This is a fully functional Password Manager that possesses almost all the features an ideal Password Manager should have (except a very few).

## Some Main Features of the project
Here are some of the key features of this Password Manager : 
### 1. It stores all your passwords in the **cloud**
  I have integrated this project with my Firebase Console developed by Google to store all the user's data
### 2. All your passwords stored in the cloud are encrypted
  All your passwords in the cloud are stored as encrypted text and not plain text and the key is generated using User Identity based key generation algorithm, so only you can view your data. Not even the admin of the cloud server (me) can view your passwords.
### 3. It has a fully functional Graphical User Interface
  I have used the [**PySimpleGUI**](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to create a fully functional GUI for a seamless experience for the user.
